- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with APIs and tool development
- Google AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

## üèóÔ∏è Workshop Structure

### Phase 1: Agent Architecture (20 minutes)
**Objective:** Create the root agent with proper ADK integration

**Your Tasks:**
1. **Agent Definition** (12 min)
   - Implement `agents/agent.py` with root_agent variable
   - Import required modules and tools
   - Configure agent with proper parameters for classification focus

2. **Tool Integration** (8 min)
   - Connect all 5 ML tools to the agent
   - Ensure proper tool parameter passing
   - Validate agent initialization

**Key Requirements:**
- Must use `root_agent` variable name for ADK web compatibility
- Include all 5 classification tools: `train_ml_model`, `predict_with_model`, `list_available_models`, `list_available_datasets`, `detect_target_column_from_query`
- Use Gemini 2.0 Flash model from config
- Focus on classification-only functionality

### Phase 2: ML Tools Implementation (30 minutes)
**Objective:** Implement the core ML functionality with guided scaffolding

**Your Tasks:**
1. **Core Training Function** (18 min)
   - Implement `train_ml_model` with classification algorithms
   - Handle data preprocessing, categorical encoding, and scaling
   - Support Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression
   - Proper model persistence and evaluation

2. **Utility Functions** (12 min)
   - Implement `list_available_models` for model discovery
   - Implement `list_available_datasets` for data exploration

**Key Requirements:**
- Support Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression
- Handle categorical features and missing values
- Proper model persistence and loading
- Classification-only focus (no regression)

**Note:** The `predict_with_model` function is already implemented and working - you don't need to modify it.

### Phase 3: Intelligent Prompt Engineering (20 minutes)
**Objective:** Create comprehensive agent instructions for smart ML assistance

**Your Tasks:**
1. **Role Definition & Intent Analysis** (10 min)
   - Define agent as expert ML Classification Assistant

   - Create keyword-based routing system

2. **Tool Routing & Response Logic** (10 min)
   - Implement smart parameter handling for each tool
   - Create dataset and target column detection logic
   - Build comprehensive response formatting rules

**Key Requirements:**
- Only support classification (no regression)
- Smart target column detection with confidence levels
- Proper label decoding for classification predictions
- Educational explanations for all operations

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (5 minutes)
**Objective:** Verify complete system functionality

**Your Tasks:**
1. **Integration Testing** (5 min)
   - Test complete training workflow
   - Test prediction workflow with label decoding
   - Verify ADK web compatibility
